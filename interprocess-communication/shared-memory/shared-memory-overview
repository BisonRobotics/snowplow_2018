normally when processes run, their respective memory spaces are mapped to different physical address spaces. 
shared memory is a way for multiple processes to access the same physical memory. This allows one process
to write information to the shared pool of memory and another process to read from that same pool of shared
memory, allowing interprocess communication. precautions must be taken to ensure that one process does not
read too early
